# odin-recipes

This is a website containing my weekly recipes. It is not meant to showcase special, delicious recipes, just how I (a spoonie with ADHD) feed myself during the week.

This project shows that I can work with html and understand how websites are structured. It also shows I can work with GIT and GITHUB.
